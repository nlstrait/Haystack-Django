# YouTube Moments - Back End
YouTube Moments allows you to resurface memorable moments from your liked YouTube videos. If you love listening to long-form podcasts, interviews, and lectures, but forget where you heard that genius comment, YouTube Moments empowers your search. By digesting the transcripts of your liked videos, YouTube Moments enables you to search semantically by phrase, synonym, and broad category. No more vague keyword searches that only lead to click-baity titles and still 3 hours of video to scrub through. Find the exact moment you are looking for.
